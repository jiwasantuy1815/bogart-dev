Disables all RSS/Atom/RDF feeds on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Disable Feeds WP is a WordPress plugin to disable all RSS/Atom/RDF WordPress feeds on your website/blog. It is very useful if you use WordPress purely as a content management system (and not for blogging). All requests for feeds will be redirected to the corresponding HTML content.

There are a couple of options to tweak the plugin's behavior - go to `Settings -> Reading` to see them.

Hereâ€™s a link to the documentation for the plugin. This will help you learn more about its features and how to use it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I disable feeds? =

WordPress Feeds are useful if you have regularly updated content (blog posts, comments) on your site, and you want people to be able to subscribe to those updates. If you have static pages, then they aren't, and just add overhead to your site.

= There are still RSS links on my site! =

This plugin is only able to disable WordPress feeds. The links to feeds are generated by your theme, and you will have to edit your theme (or remove the related widgets) to remove those links.

= What if I don't want to redirect feed requests? =

In `Settings -> Reading` you will find an option to turn off redirection and issue a 404 (page not found) response instead.

= What if I want to keep the main post/comment feeds but disable all other feeds? =

In `Settings -> Reading` you will find an option to allow global feeds. All other feeds (individual post comments, archives, search, category, etc.) will still be disabled.
